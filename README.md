# Detecting Real vs Fake Job Advertisements Using AI

##  Project Overview
Online job platforms have become increasingly popular, but with their growth comes the rise of fake job postings that can harm job seekers.
This project aims to:
- Classify job postings as real or fake.
- Analyze key differences between genuine and fraudulent postings.
- Generate human-readable insights using AI (Google Colab for data analysis and IBM Granite for summarization).

## Dataset
- Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/real-or-fake-fake-jobposting-prediction

## Insight & Findings
1. Data Distribution
- The majority of vacancies are real, only a small portion are fake.
2. Company Information
Real → long and detailed company profile.
Fake → minimal details, just the company name without explanation.
3. Job Description
Real → clear description (duties, skills, experience).
Fake → generic, short, often exaggerated description.
4. Red Flags
Fake postings: requests for payment, promises of immediate acceptance, or suspicious contact emails.
